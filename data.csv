The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed

Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, ""Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi""
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

Left the canyon, drove to the club

I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed

But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
And now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have
You couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
So I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door
Mmm

We hate Tears In Heaven
But it's sad that his baby died
And we fought about John Lennon

Until I cried
And then went to bed upset

But now I am dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
And I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
But can't for the life of me
Remember what it is

And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

Cutting through my body in familiar ways
Well is it me or is it you who can’t relate?

The useless seems to matter more and more
All my life is just something I can’t ignore
Consumed and enthused by all that came before
'Cause I can feel it
When those warm jets start to roar

Give me everything I ever need
Or just enough so I can go to sleep

Cutting through my body in familiar ways
Well is it me or is it you who can’t relate?

The useless seems to matter more and more
All my life is just something I can’t ignore
Consumed and enthused by all that came before

I am lost
In a rainbow
Now our rainbow
Is gone
Overcast
By your shadow
As our worlds move on

In this shirt
I can be you
To be near you
For a while
In this shirt
I can be you
To be near you

There's a crane
Knocking down
All these things
That we were
I awake
In the night
Hear the engines pout

There's a pain
It does ripple
Through my frame
Makes me lame
There's a thorn
In my side
It's the shame
It's the prize


Of you and me
Ever changing
Moving on now
Moving fast
And this touch
Must be wanting
Must become
Free to act

But I mean
Take to tell you
That I love you
It never ends
And I bled
Everyday now
For a year
For a year


I did send
You a note
On the wind
For to read
Our names
There together
Must've fallen
Like the sea

To depths
Of the soil
Buried deep
In the ground
On the wind
I can hear you
Call my name
Held the sound


I am lost

(One, two...)

Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see

Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but

Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, ""You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me""
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability

Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt

I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that

I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound

My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby

I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side

Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place

By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down

I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine

How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I cum
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude

And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted

But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you're here, they don't deserve you""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know

'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see

Because of leaving

So if I seem a little out of it
Sorry
Why should I lie?

And I've gotta hear the same sermon all the time now from you people
Why are you staring into outer space

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

[ Adele & Angelo Adkins]
Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе


[ Angelo Adkins & Adele]
Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel likе that?
Do you like me?
You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)
[ Adele & Angelo Adkins]
Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, mummy, I'm, I'm, the feeling that I have

Like, um, I feel a bit confused
Why?
I don't know
And I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make me go...

My little love
Tell me, do you, you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

[ Adele & Angelo Adkins]
I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me

You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, I feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating

And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
And I feel like today, I'm home and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that, but I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot",sad

My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around

Hello, hello, are you lonely?
I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
I'm called Mr. Forgettable

(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Mr. Forgettable

The old mе hides
While the nеw me fights
Look in my eyes
He's still in there, right?
Did the kitchen change?
What about your name?
You used to be my heart
And now you're just a face

My head is in the clouds right now
Just pray I come around, around (oh-oh)

Hello, hello, are you lonely?

I'm sorry, it's just the chemicals
Hello, hello, do you know me?
I'm called Mr. Forgettable
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I’ve been taken
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I’ve been holding on to hope
That you’ll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I’ve heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I’ve been told, I’ve been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side


There must be something in the water
'Cause every day it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I’m just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it’s over
Well, there must be something in the tide

Cocked to the undertow

Wagging your face around

But everything heaven sent
Must burn out in the end
I promised you
Just as you were in my dream
Now let me off easy
And I'll slip down through the drain
To release my scattered brain

Something just isn't right
I cut from the inside

I'm drowning in my self-defense
Now punish me

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive

Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes


And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh

Lleno de este veneno y oigo truenos si no estás

¿Qué me has hecho? ¿Dónde estoy?
Se me aparecen mil planetas de repente
Esto es una alucinación
Quiero ver tu otra mitad
Alejarme de esta ciudad
Y contagiarme de tu forma de pensar


Miro al cielo al recordar
Me doy cuenta una vez más
Que no hay momento que pase sin dejarte de pensar
Esta distancia no es normal
Ya me he cansado de esperar
Dos billetes para amarte no quiero ver nada más

Imposible, es demasiado tarde
Todo es un desastre
Esto es una obsesión
No me sirven tus pocas señales
Ya nada es como antes
Me olvido de quien soy

¿Qué me has hecho?
¿Dónde estoy?
No vas de frente, es lo de siempre
Y de repente estoy perdiendo la razón

Cien complejos sin sentido
Me arrebatan tus latidos y tu voz
Y ya no puedo más

Qué no se a donde voy
No es real
Hace ya tiempo te volviste uno más
Y odio cuanto estoy
Lleno de este veneno y oigo truenos si no estás

Imposible, es demasiado tarde
Todo es un desastre
Esto es una obsesión
No me sirven tus pocas señales
Ya nada es como antes
Me olvido de quien soy

¿Y dónde estás?

La verdad es que ya van mil noches malditas sin tu abrazo
Es algo raro estoy viciado a tu amor
Quiero verte, verte, verte
Que se acabe ya",sad

Telling myself ""I won't go there""
Oh but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt

(Ooh)
There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
But I know I can't resist it

Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight

From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's night time
Please, don't leave me in the end

There's darkness in the distance
I'm beggin' for forgiveness
But I know I might resist it, oh

Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

Remember every moment on the nights with you

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?

How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange

You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naïve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will

You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart

You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will

Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naïve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire

(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart

I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes

Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old


I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

(Lukas Graham!!!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major

I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me

Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me

Soon I'll be 60 years old

You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does

You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over

You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

She's wearing an old dress, walking it out
Waiting for someone to turn her around
But she won't believe you
When you fall down on your knees
She fell asleep listening to my friends
Talking on and on about how the world ends
Then she wakes up
And climbs in my front seat

And she said
""Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?""

Let's lay in the dead grass, stare at the stars

Run away and live out of cars and bars
Let's just leave here
'Cause there's nothing left to see
And if that's wrong, let's make it right
And if you leave, just give me one more night
'Cause there's no one
That you'll find that's quite like me

It's been a long day without you, my friend

We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed

Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was livin' in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)

When you're out of sight in my mind

'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said, ""I'm fine"" and said, ""I moved on""

I'm only here passin' time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryna give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh

I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's witchu in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems

The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is

But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Momma's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree

And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum see, Daddy had a job but his job
Was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom and at the time
Every house that we lived in either kept gettin'
Broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your Mom
Was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your Momma's heart

And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit

And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?

Shh! Momma's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine

I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat
Don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)",sad

Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down

I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me

All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me

You're my downfall, you're my muse

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here

To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

No make-up, just JAY-Z
You were balls deep, now we beefin'
Had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted, screamin', ""Fuck that""
Blurry now, but I meant it then
Hurry now, baby, stick it in
'fore the memories get to kickin' in

It's too late, I don't wanna lose

What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell ya?
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?

Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do, nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do, nobody gets me, you do
You do, nobody gets me, you do

Took me out to the ballet
You proposed, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty so you left me
Now I'm stuck, dealin' with a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man, it's you

And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose

What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell ya?

I don't wanna see you with anyone but me
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do, nobody gets me, you do (Do)
You do, nobody gets me, you do (Do)

You do, nobody gets me, you do (Do)
Nobody gets me, you do",sad

I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly


Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace

So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down

If you're leaving baby let me down slowly

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

There's a few lines that I have wrote
In case of death, that's what I want
That's what I want
So don't be sad when I'll be gone
There's just one thing I hope you know
I loved you so
'Cause I don't even care about the time I've got left here

The only thing I know now is that I want to spend it
With you, with you
Nobody else here
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

You'll be the saddest part of me
A part of me that will never be mine
It's obvious
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest
You're still the oxygen I breathe
I see your face when I close my eyes
It's torturous
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest

I'm sorry but I gotta go
If you'll ever miss me
Give this song another go

And I just keep on thinking how you made me feel better
And all the crazy little things that we did together
In the end, in the end, it doesn't matter
If tonight is gonna be the loneliest

Swinging in the backyard

Pull up in your fast car

Whistling my name



Open up a beer

And you take it over here

And play a video game



I'm in his favorite sun dress

Watching me get undressed

Take that body downtown



I say you the bestest

Lean in for a big kiss

Put his favorite perfume on




Go play a video game



It's you, it's you, it's all for you

Everything I do

I tell you all the time

Heaven is a place on earth with you

Tell me all the things you want to do

I heard that you like the bad girls

Honey, is that true?

It's better than I ever even knew

They say that the world was built for two

Only worth living if somebody is loving you

Baby now you do



Singing in the old bars

Swinging with the old stars

Living for the fame




Kissing in the blue dark

Playing pool and wild darts

Video games



He holds me in his big arms

Drunk and I am seeing stars

This is all I think of



Watching all our friends fall

In and out of Old Paul's

This is my idea of fun

Playing video games



It's you, it's you, it's all for you

I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands

I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting, patient, for me

And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home

Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true

And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farest place on my shelf

And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?

I swear I'll always give my best, no pretending

Take a second just to make our connection
I would do anything for your affection

That I've been washin' my hands in forever

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd've known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go

Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay it
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface

[Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drownin' under water
And it's the light that's in the air
When you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on though the roads long
Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finding hope in who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Logic]

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
Who can relate?
I've been on the low
I been taking my time

I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Logic]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die

[Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow

But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna
I don’t even wanna die anymore",sad

Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes

We gotta get away from here

Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

Early mornin'
There's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying ""Darlin', please come home""
I fear the worst
But how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say, but there's so little time

So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

When I couldn't

You always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared
Of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes

And I promise, if you go
I will make sure she's alright

So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again

You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too

Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead""

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

There goes my heart beating
Cause you are the reason
I'm losing my sleep
Please come back now

There goes my mind racing
And you are the reason
That I'm still breathing
I'm hopeless now

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see
That you are the reason


There goes my hands shaking
Cause you are the reason
My heart keeps bleeding
And I need you now

If I could turn back the clock
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark
I'd spend every hour, of every day
Keeping you safe

I'd climb every mountain
And swim every ocean
Just to be with you
And fix what I've broken
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see
That you are the reason

I guess all the mountains that I moved just weren't enough
And all those nights I walked you home
From crowded bars, when you were drunk
Well they meant nothing 'cause you up and walked away
And I just wonder what it'd take to make you stay

'Cause when you said jump, I said how high?
But when I jumped, you said goodbye

I woulda walked through hell
To find another way
I woulda laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I woulda crossed the stars

To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight

Without you here tonight

What did you do with all that love you couldn't give?
And do you need someone to help you?
Tell you what to do with it?
It must be nice to love someone who puts you first
Then walk away when they expect it in return

'Cause when you said jump, I said how high?
But when I jumped, you said goodbye

Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone...
You locked yourself in the bathroom;
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming ""Please don't leave me!""

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life

A long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still

But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you

She ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of

Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl

But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall

In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

We clutch it isn't much
But its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us
Its lust its torturous 
You must be a sorceress cause you just
Did the impossible
Gain my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
Cause if I get burnt imma show you what its like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold

Walk down this road all alone
Its no one's fault but my own
Its the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking hoes
Bloodsucking succubus what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
Its sucks but its exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Somethin I wont go on til you toy with my emotion so its over
Its like an explosion everytime I hold ya wasn't joking when I told ya

Ya take my breathe away
You're a supernova.. and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go

No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
Its not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin but I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Lets cut to the chase
But a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I wont be making a mistake


(refrain)

So after a year and 6 months its no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to god
Ill blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick

Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But its over now
Its too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause imma

And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you",sad

Dear God, please hear me out
I know it's been a couple years
Since I've reached out and said hello
I bet you're wondering why I keep
Obsessing on and stressing all the little things
When I should be living life and soaking up the memories
I know I've been selfish, I have
No excuse to give you, it's true
Hanging by a thread's how I live
I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable

Living in my agony
Watching my self-esteem go up in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks

When I know truthfully that that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask you
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help, but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy

Yeah, been this way so long
It feels like something's off when I'm not depressed
I got some issues that I won't address
I got some baggage I ain't open yet
I got some demons I should put to rest
I got some traumas that I can't forget
I got some phone calls I've been avoiding
Some family members I don't really connect with

Some things I said, I wish I woulda not let slip
Some hurtful words that never shoulda left my lips
Some bridges burned, I'm not ready to rebuild yet
Some insecurities I haven't dealt with, yes
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul
And the last to admit I need a hand to hold
Losing hope, heading down a dangerous road
Strange, I know, but I feel most at home when I'm

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?

How to let you go and let communication die out

Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it doesn’t sound the same
When our friends talk about you all that it does, is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sound like uh, uh, uh

Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have give you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she’s dancing with another man.

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Cause a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean out the mess I made oh oh oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh

Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have give you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she’s dancing with another man.

Although it hurts, I’ll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I’m probably much too late
To try to apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds yours hands
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What if I'm someone I don't want around?

I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far

Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone

Sunday mornings were your favorite
I used to meet you down on Woods Creek Road
You did your hair up like you were famous
Even though it's only church where we were going
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
It's like I've buried my faith with you
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
'Cause I don't know what else I can do

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far

Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

Digging through your old birthday letters
A crumpled twenty still in the box
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

Oh, I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far

Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
You took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), holding on
I'm still holding (On), holding (On), I'm still holding on
I'm still holding, ooh, still holding on

I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far

Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons

I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad; it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will


I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel

It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

Or the Fourth of July?

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction

Now, where am I? My fading supply

""Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""

The hospital asked, ""Should the body be cast?""
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
Threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that’s been loved

Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me don’t you cry when you’re down
But mum there’s a tear every time that I blink

Oh I’m in pieces it’s tearing me up but I know
A heart that’s broke is a heart that’s been loved


So I’ll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you’d be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he’d drive, then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that’s been lived


So I’ll sing Hallelujah, you were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you’d be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

There's never been a moment
You were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen

I hear you whisper underneath your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS

I will send out an army
To find you in the middle of darkest night
It's true
I will rescue you

There is no distance

That cannot be covered
Over and over
You're not defenseless
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your armor

Roads that go nowhere
I know that somewhere better

Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

Would you take the wheel

If I lose control?
If I'm lying here
Will you take me home?

Could you take care

Will you hold me now?

You rationalize my darkest thoughts
Yeah you, set them free

Know where to start

Anger, love, confusion
Roads that go nowhere
I know that somewhere better
Cause you always take me there

Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

Would you take the wheel

If I lose control?
If I'm lying here
Will you take me home?

Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?

Hold the gun to my head
Count 1, 2, 3
If it helps me walk away then it's
What I need


Every minute gets easier
The more you talk to me
You rationalize my darkest thoughts
Yeah you, set them free

Came to you with a broken faith
Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lying here
Will you take me home?

Could you take care

Oh, will you hold me now?

Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?
Oh, will you take me home?

You say space will make it better
And time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever
And soon I wouldn't feel
Like I'm haunted, oh falling

You say space will make it better
And time will make it heal
I won't be lost forever

That feeling that doesn't go away just did
And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The color of my blood is all I see on the rocks
As you sail from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach
My flesh will flee
So help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows, I'm not dying but I bleed now
And God knows, it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you

It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams are buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of a love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see
As you steal my soul from me

Those hardfaced queen of misadventure...

God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes,
A fiery strong of muted angels
Giving love and getting nothing back, Oh.

Behind the tears, inside the lies,
A thousand slowly dying sunsets

I guess the loneliness came knocking
No one needs to be alone, Oh save me!

Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game,
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey,
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio.
Standing in the sunlight laughing

Hide behind a rainbow's wall,
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah.

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own.
I saw you just the other day,
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord,
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about

Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl,
You, my brown-eyed girl.

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass

So build me up (Build me up)
Buttercup, don't break my heart

""I'll be over at ten"", you told me time and again
But you're late, I wait around and then (Ba-dah-dah)

I went to the door, I can't take any more
It's not you, you let me down again (Hey, hey, hey)

Baby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey)
A little time and I'll make you happy (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Why do you build me up (Build me up)
Buttercup, baby
Just to let me down? (Let me down)
And mess me around
And then, worst of all (Worst of all)
You never call, baby
When you say you will (Say you will)

But I love you still
I need you (I need you)
More than anyone, darling
You know that I have from the start
So build me up (Build me up)
Buttercup, don't break my heart

To you, I'm a toy, but I could be the boy you adore
If you'd just let me know (Ba-dah-dah)
Although you're untrue, I'm attracted to you all the more
Why do I need you so? (Hey, hey, hey)

Baby, baby, try to find (Hey, hey, hey)
A little time and I'll make you happy (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone waiting for you

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

Why do you build me up (Build me up)
Buttercup, baby
Just to let me down? (Let me down)
And mess me around
And then, worst of all (Worst of all)
You never call, baby
When you say you will (Say you will)
But I love you still
I need you (I need you)

You know that I have from the start

I see them bloom, for me and you

The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself

So pretty in the sky

Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
They're really saying, I love you

I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight

And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still

Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere.

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all.
Now I feel ten feet tall.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see.
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to C.

My life was torn like a wind-blown sand,
And the rock was formed when you held my hand.

Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Yeah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you

The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace

Don't throw our love away

Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me

My love, my baby love

I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

Baby, baby, ooh 'til it's hurtin' me
'Til it's hurtin' me
Ooh, baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away",happy

Ooh baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay

Need ya, need ya
Baby love, ooh, baby love

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we seperate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do
I get this need

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you

You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not

Wanna give myself to you

Yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind
(You got me stuck on the thought of you)
I'm feeling like this might be my time
To shine with you, with you, with you

I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blasting our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're making me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

It’s a beautiful night,
We’re looking for something dumb to do.
Hey baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby,
I think I wanna marry you.

Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go,
No one will know,
Come on girl.
Who cares if we’re trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow,

Shots of patron,
And it’s on girl.

Don’t say no, no, no, no-no;
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah;
And we’ll go, go, go, go-go.
If you’re ready, like I’m ready.

I’ll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oooh,
So whatcha wanna do?
Let’s just run girl.
If we wake up and you wanna break up that’s cool.
No, I won’t blame you;
It was fun girl.

Don’t say no, no, no, no-no;
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah;

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you

I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your innovations
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else

Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

She's got to save him (Daily struggle) 

She tells him, ""Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
Nobody matters like you"" 
(Stay out there, stay out there)

Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah) 
Just so you know that you really care 
Cause any obstacle come you’re well prepared (Oh no) 
And no mama, you never shed tear 
Cause you have to shed things year after year 
And you give the youth love beyond compare (Yeah) 

You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah) 
Mmm Marie, the paps' disappear 
In the round back can’t find him nowhere 
Steadily you work flow, everything you know 
You know say you nuh stop the time fi a jear

Now she got a six-year-old 
Trying to keep him warm 
Trying to keep out the cold 
When he looks in her eyes 
He don't know he is safe

Call it love and devotion

She works the night, by the water 
She's gonna stress, so far away 
From her father's daughter 
She just wants a life for her baby 
All on her own, no one will come 

She's got to save him (Daily struggle) 

She tells him, ""Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
Nobody matters like you"" 
(Stay out there, stay out there) 

She tells him, ""Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life 
You're gonna grow and have a good life 
I'm gonna do what I've got to do""

We were good, we were gold
Kind of dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I

I can buy myself flowers

Match the roses that you left

It was nice to know you oooh
Ah oooh, Ah oooh

I met her at a beach house in Bel Air
She was hanging with some kids I used to know
You can tell a lot about a girl by her hands
Especially when they're wrapped around your throat

That angelic kind of devil you meet after dark
Only took us 20 minutes til we called a car
Said she had a suite in Chateau Marmont
I don't know what we took, but she took my heart
She is a starlight always gone by sunrise


It was nice to know you for a while
'Cause it's been forever since I smiled
Gonna play this moment in my head
Even if I don't see you again
Maybe I'm just going through denial
But I love the way you keep me wild
Baby I'll keep dreaming of your bed
Even if I don't see you again

It was nice to know you oooh

Baby after you I'll never be the same
It's like tryna light a cigarette in the rain
I still got the shirt with the smell of your perfume

Never thought I'd settled down
But for you I could learn to
She is a starlight always gone by sunrise

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep.
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You’d think me rude but I would just stand and stare.

I’d like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It’s hard to say that I’d rather stay awake when I’m asleep
cause everything is never as it seems.

Cause I’d get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs

As they tried to teach me how to dance
A fox trot above my head, a sock hopped beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)

I’d like to make myself believe
that planet Earth turns slowly
It’s hard to say that I’d rather stay awake when I’m asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep

(Please take me away from here)
when I’m far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I’m weird ’cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(they said farewell)
But I’ll know where several are
if my dreams get real bizarre
‘Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(in a jar)

I’d like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly.
It’s hard to stay that I’d rather stay awake when I’m asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems

Runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' off the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone live
Everything is so fire
A little bit of sunshine

Crazy lately I'm confirmin'
Tryna write myself a sermon
You just tryna get a word in, life is not fair
I been workin' on my tunnel vision
Tryna get a new prescription
Takin' swings and even missin' but I don't care


I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-hoo!
I'm makin' more just a little bit
Spend a little more to get rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it

I, I, I, I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights

A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine

Another day, another selfish moment
I've been feelin' helpless
Sick of seein' all the selfies, now I don't care
Found myself a new vocation
Calibrated motivation
No more static, change the station
Head to somewhere

I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-hoo!
I'm makin' more just a little bit

A little bit of sunshine

I don't really know any other way to say this
Can't slow down tryna keep up with the changes
Punch that number in the name when I clock in
And now I feel like Michael with a cane when I walk in

Basically life is the same thing
Unless you don't want the same thing
Probably shoulda went and got a feature, but I didn't
I've been savin' up the money 'cause it's better for the business

I didn’t want to settle down.

Looking for a way that I can see your face.

I used to want to be
Living like there's only me.
But now I spend my time
Thinking ‘bout a way to get you off my mind.
I used to be so tough.
Never really gave enough.
And then you caught my eye.
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike.

Look at me now. I’m falling.
I can’t even talk, still stuttering.
This ground of mine keeps shaking
Oh oh oh. Now...

I used to run around.
I didn’t want to settle down.
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face.
I’ve got your photograph.
But baby I need more than that.
I need to know your lips.
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this.

I just wanna be deep in your love

I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Ooh baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Sugar, yes please

And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say ""Hey""

And you wear them around like they ain't shit

That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it

And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down


[ Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Adam Levine]
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh


[Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[ Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise


[Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (yeah)

[Adam Levine]
If ""happy ever after"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering

Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)
(Yeah)

Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

Ridin' high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you want me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So, any time I need ya, let me go

Yah, any time I feed you, get me? No
Any time I see you, let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't want to lose you
Hey yeah, ratatata

I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
And put your loving hand out darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell

I used to be
The shadow of my life
Was hangin over me
A broken man
But I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance
To win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
What about 'em, why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You on a runway track from the good
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react
Like the heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it away, ya' had it till you took it back

But I keep walkin' on
Keep rockin' dawns
Keep walking forward
Now the court is yours
Keep browsin' halls
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl I'm beggin'

Mhh ye-e-e-ah
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

I'm fightin' hard
To hold my own

In that all white dress with her back out
Said, ""Be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile""
And thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out
See, with me, it ain't no worries at all
Any problem, I'll be there, one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you, I hang pictures on my wall
Roll one, let's get high tonight

Backseat, Maybach, lavish life
Chillin' with the stars like a satellite
AP on my arm and it's shinin' bright, uh

Livin' in a haze (Haze), stayin' in the shade (The shade)
All I do is sit around and wait for better days (Sit around and wait)
I could use a break, can I get an ""Amen""? (Amen)

Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shades
Lookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway
Bottle of Cîroc with a hint of Kool-Aid
She done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds
Are you tired from running through my mind
Take a break and we can have a good time
Show you moves like I'm the new James Brown
Me and you should get a room right now

[Mikey]
'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
It ain't gonn' work if you don't want it too
Best drink I take is when I'm sippin' you


[Mikey]
You know where I go when we're dancing
Handshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you
And you look so classy, come through with that magic
You know that I'm bout to smash it, it's true

[Mikey]
I can take to the room, I can take you to the beach
But we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep
You can be that early bird, Imma get that worm
You and me, I'll take you 'round the world

[Mikey]

'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away
You're worth more than every single chain
Walk with a limp, it just means I'm cool
Next trip I take is just me and you

Lil Boat
You said you lovin' up north when you comin' to the A
You said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay

I know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace
I'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face
I wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh I wanna sing
Take you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling
Don't know if you're the one but if you are, you'll get a ring
That's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things
I'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first
As you whip the Coupe around, use the seat belt first
New shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse
Vacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse

I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this

Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'

But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it

Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
Is this a hickie or a bruise?

Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a Menage a trois

I miss the days to the sweet lie
I miss the conversation
I’m searching for a song tonight
I’m changing all of the stations
I like to think through, we had it all
We drove 'em out to a better place

But I’m not running I’m super fun
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you

When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And instead of my having back
So I wonder where were you
All the worse you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you

The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
And nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice at my sleeping night
Hard to resist temptation

Cause all the strangers come over me
Now I can’t get over you
No, I just can’t get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And instead of my having back
So I wonder where were you

Clock strikes upon the hour
and the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
how to chase my blues away

I've done alright up till now
it's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
loneliness calls

Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody

Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

and lost my senses
spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
and I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
on a love that burns hot enough to last

my lonely heart calls

Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone

I’m gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobodys gon’ tell me I can’t

I’ll be lying on the couch just chillin in my snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
Cus in my castle I’m the freakin man

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said no more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars

Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told


I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie

Got a bug from you girl
But I don't need no cure
I'll just stay a victim

Deep inside on me
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me

When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Everything's all right

I'm hooked on a feeling

I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me

Lips as sweet as candy
Its taste is on my mind
Girl, you got me thirsty
For another cup o' wine

Got a bug from you girl
But I don't need no cure
I'll just stay a victim
If I can for sure

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
(Ohhh)

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.

Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string

oh who would ever want to be king

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
Or where ever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""how you been""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh but that one night was still the highlight

I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell

I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleepin' I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read

If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape


I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half bad

Yes, I like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's where we'll plan our escape

So I waited with high hopes and she walked in the place

I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady and she said, ""Aw, it's you.""
Then we laughed for a moment and I said, ""I never knew.""

That you like piña coladas and gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight in the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for, come with me and escape

We'll take it slow

Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again

So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat

We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow
It's hard to feel you slipping (You need to know)
Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)

And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?

You could be casually datin'

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
But I couldn’t, couldn’t get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up

It was a crush

Now I might have went and said too much
But that’s all it was
So I gave it up

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna

Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept saying I’mma stay in touch
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up


No tricks, no bluff
I’m just better off without them cuffs
Yeah the sun won’t set on us

Went low, went high
Still waters run dry 
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain’t ever worry

Went low, went high
What matters is now
Getting right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna


Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
(x2)

Ouh ouh ....

Hope when the water rises
You built a wall

They're screaming your name

When you first left me I was wanting more 

But you were fucking that girl next door, what ja do that for 

When you first left me I didn't know what to say 

I never been on my own that way, just sat by myself all day



I was so lost back then 

But with a little help from my friends

I found a light in the tunnel at the end

Now you're calling me up on the phone

So you can have a little whine and a moan

And it's only because you're feeling alone



At first when I see you cry, 

yeah it makes me smile, yeah it makes my smile


At worst I feel bad for a while, 

but then I just smile I go ahead and smile



Whenever you see me you say that you want me back

And I tell you it don't mean jack, no it don't mean jack

I couldn't stop laughing, no I just could help myself

See you messed up my mental health I was quite unwell

Guided by a beating heart 
I can't tell where the journey will end 
But I know where it starts﻿ 
They tell me I'm too young to understand 
They say I'm caught up in a dream 
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes

(Refrain: Adam Levine)
My heart’s a stereo
It beats for your, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note

Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

(Travie McCoy)
If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Will you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that

Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
This the last girl that play me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I’m over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I sing a song and the image grab me by the hands
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

If I wasn’t old school, fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk
Would you turn my volume up before of the cops

And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don’t get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like we’re on the interstate
I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear it, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep myself inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long

We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove

Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love",in-love

Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you


More than words

Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
`Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor n'guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl u better try to have fun
No matter what you'll do
But he's a fool
`Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

all the flowers that you planted, mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away

But I'm willing to give it another try

to celebrate
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
no first of spring
no song to sing
in fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain
no flowers bloom
no wedding saturday within the month of June
But what it is
Is something true
Made up of these 3 words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you

And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No libra sun
No halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you Bring
But what it is
Though old so new
To fill your heart like no 3 words Could ever do.

Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
and think of you
caught up in circles confusion--
is nothing new
Flashback--warm nights--
almost left behind
suitcases of memories,
time after--

sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
you're calling to me, I can't hear
what you've said--
Then you say--go slow--
I fall behind--
the second hand unwinds


chorus:
if you're lost you can look--and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
time after time

after my picture fades and darkness has
turned to gray
watching through windows--you're wondering
if I'm OK
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time--",in-love

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul who could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark,
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight.Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Once upon a time I was falling in love But now I'm only falling apart.

There's nothing I can do A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life but now 
there's only love in the dark,
Nothing I can say a total eclipse of the heart

Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to 
the sound of my tears.
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years 
have gone by.
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified 
and then I see the look in your eyes.

Turn around Bright eyes

Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart

Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child 
in your arms,
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I know I've got to 
get out and cry.
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see 

the look in your eyes.

Turn around Bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart 

And I need you now tonight; And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever,
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be 
wrong together 
We can take it to the end of the line.

Once upon a time there was light in my life but now

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you
always wanted to be

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy
who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no-one in the universe as
magical and wonderous as you
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better there's 
nothing that I just wouldn't do

Turn around Bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart 
Turn around bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart


And I need you now tonight; And I need you more than ever

And I don't see you anymore.

I'll take you just the way you are.

Don't go trying, some new fashion,

I never want to work that hard,

The same old someone that I knew,
What will it take till you believe in me,

Come away with me in the night

Come away with me

And I will write you a song



Come away with me on a bus

Come away where they can't tempt us

With their lies



I want to walk with you

On a cloudy day

In fields where the yellow grass grows

Knee high

So won't you try to come



Come away with me and we'll kiss

On a mountain top


Come away with me

And I'll never stop loving you



And I want to wake up with the rain

Falling on a tin roof

While I'm safe there in your arms

So all I ask is for you

To come away with me in the night

Living A Life That I Can't Leave Behind

I will be there, I will be there

All the way from the start

I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again
I'm loving you

Try, baby try
To trust in my love again
I will be there, I will be there

Just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there, I will be there

I guess it's true I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man

I don't want you to leave me, will you hold my hand?

Oh won't you stay with me

But darling stay with me

Why am I so emotional

My love,
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright

My first love,
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I

I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do...

And your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes

They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts,
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun

Forever
(Ohhhhhh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

Half as much as I do
And I never thought I'd feel this way
The way I feel
About you
As soon as I wake up

I know that it's you I need

It must be love, love, love,
Nothing more, nothing less
Love is the best

How can it be that we can

Say so much without words?
Bless you and bless me

I've got to be near you
Every night, every day
I couldn't be happy
Any other way

For you there'll be no crying
For you the sun will be shining
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's all right I know it's right

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you I love you I love you
Like never before

To you I would give the world
To you I'd never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's all right I know it's right

And the songbirds keep singing

And I love you I love you I love you

How sweet it is to be loved by you.
How sweet it is to be loved by you.

I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were.
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were.
With sweet love and devotion, deeply touching my emotion,
I want to stop and thank you baby. I want to stop and thank you baby.
How sweet it is to be loved by you. How sweet it is to be loved by you.

I close my eyes at night wondering where would I be without you in my life.

Everything I did was just a bore, everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before.
But you brighten up for me all of my days with a love so sweet in so many ways,
I want to stop and thank you baby, I just want to stop and thank you baby.
How sweet it is to be loved by you, feels so fine. How sweet it is to be loved by you.

You were better for me than I was for myself,
for me, there's you and there ain't nobody else,
I want to stop and thank you baby. I just want to stop and thank you baby, yes I do,
how sweet it is to be loved by you. How sweet it is to be loved by you.
Feels so fine, how sweet it is to be loved by you.
Just like jelly baby, oh yeah, how sweet it is to be loved by you.

Just like honey to the bee, babe, how sweet it is to be loved by you.",in-love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue

I'd go crawling down the avenue
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

Nothing that I wouldn't do

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song

Then you saw me for me
Made me believe in myself
On the day that I met you
It all turned around

You said close your eyes
Don't look down

Fall into me
And I'll catch you, darlin'
We'll dance in the street
Like nobody's watching

It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice
High on the moment
I'd fall for you twice
If that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life
From now till forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again

Until I had met you
There was no sun in my sky
No mirrors for monsters
No love in sight
Then you walked down those stairs
And I knew my heart wasn't mine

On the day that I met you
My whole world came alive

You said close your eyes
I got you now

Fall into me
And I'll catch you, darlin'
We'll dance in the street
Like nobody's watching
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice
High on the moment
I'd fall for you twice
If that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life

From now till forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again

I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over

Fall into me
And I'll catch you, darlin'
Let's dance in the streets
Like nobody's watching
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over

I'm drunk on your voice
High on the moment
I'd fall for you twice
If that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life
From now till forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again

Fall into me
And I'll catch you, darlin'
Let's dance in the streets
Like nobody's watching
It's just you and me
And the song on repeat in our heads",in-love

Even when the sun don't shine

Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She wont believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think she don't see what I see

But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say


When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day


Oh you know, you know, you know
Id never ask you to change
If perfect is what you're searching for
Then just stay the same

So don't even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are


The way you are
The way you are

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would have known from the look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneakin' in

'Cause if you are a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
But there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

You know that my train could take you home

Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for

Take it
If she gives you her heart don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have

She always has trouble falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle while under the sheets
She loves pop songs
And dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies
And likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting a good compliment
She loves her whole family
And all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in


Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her like that

Kiss her with passion as much as you can
Run your hands through her hair whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice how pretty she is
Tell her over and over
So she never forgets

If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her

It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her like that

She'll love you

Take it
If she gives you her heart don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have

She always has trouble falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle while under the sheets
She loves pop songs
And dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies
And likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting a good compliment
She loves her whole family
And all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in


Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her like that

Kiss her with passion as much as you can
Run your hands through her hair whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice how pretty she is
Tell her over and over
So she never forgets


Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you, if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
If a greater wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own.

CHORUS:
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out
A way to make it back someday

To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days
If a greater wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Well then I hope there's someone out there
who can bring me back to you


CHORUS
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

Runaway with my heart
Runaway with my hope
Runaway with my love

I know now, just quite how

My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind I'll stay with you for all of time

I go out every night and sleep all day

I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
`Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor n'guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl u better try to have fun
No matter what you'll do
But he's a fool
`Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

In the back yard
All died when you went away

Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

My eyes become large and

So, thank God

I get to wake up by your side, and thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine, and thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
Ooh, yeah, thank God
Thank God (Oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah)
For giving me you

[Katelyn Brown & Kane Brown]
Never thought I'd find an angel undercover
Made a change to everything
From my heart to my last name, hey
Hard to tell when he fell
That boy was Heaven sent
And every night when I close my eyes
Before I say, ""Amen""

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans

And break 'em
This is bound to be awhile

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)

Something 'bout the way the hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and

Honey I know you'll be there to heal me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're feeling
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing
Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up, let's make love tonight
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, 'cos you do it right
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us

Sexual Healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby ohhh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need Sexual Healing",in-love

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

(first chorus)
'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can


Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn

Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Miles of windless summer night air
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say, say it again

Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you

Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever

You've got me almost melting away

You're every minute of my everyday.

Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love along the wire

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours, faithfully

Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show

Wondering where I am, lost without you

And being apart ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me

Heaven knows it's high time
And I've been waiting on my own too long
But when you hold me like you do
It feels so right

How my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on

Turning circles when time again
It cuts like a knife oh yeah
If you love me got to know for sure
Cos it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies
Before I open up my arms and fall

Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
And when you kiss me
On that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This years love had better last

Dear Judas,
My beloved you belong to me
No more backstabbing please
Your blood colored beads
Jealousy, envy, insanity

My evil Judas (death and vanity)
My evil Judas (death and vanity)
Let go of me, your poison ivy
My evil Judas (death and vanity)
Please let go, your poison ivy to me
As much as I obsess
About the sick things you do
Follow you around and stalk your every move,
I know your laughing behind closed doors, but no more, cause

I’m just a holy fool,
Oh baby he’s so cruel, but i’m still in love with Judas, baby

Uggh (death and vanity)
When he comes to me, I am ready.
I’ll wash his feet with my hair if he needs.
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain.
Even after three times he betrays me.
I’ll bring him down, a king with no crown.
Judas look what have you done
My heart bleeds and you think it’s fun?

Oh baby he’s so cruel, but i’m still in love with Judas, baby

Your bible won’t save you now
From the glares of the everlasting light, remember those hot nights where you lied and lied on my bed
Stabbed me in the back
Let my blood trickle on your rose thorns
But he came and whispered in my ear and left me torn.

Cause i’m just a holy fool,
Oh baby he’s so cruel, but i’m still in love with Judas, baby

My heart bleeds and you think it’s fun?

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways


I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so lеt me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, nah, nah-nah
A-B-C-D-E, F you

You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it

Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again

I'm not tryna have another conversation
Probably not gonna wanna play me on your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you something that you don't know
I'm the type to drive a pick up through your mansion
I'm completely naked but I'm making it fashion
Maybe getting married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you something that you don't know

Am I wrong that I moved on and I, and I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go


What the fuck do I know?
I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You wanted an apology?
Not from me
I had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go
What the fuck do I know?

Tryin' to see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm a problem? Honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you something that you don't know

Put you on a pedestal, you're craving the spotlight

Desperate for attention, nose bloody, it's daylight
Waking up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it, then I hated and let you go

Mo li prendo a calci 'sti portoni

Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori
Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori, ma

Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro

Io ho scritto pagine e pagine
Ho visto sale, poi lacrime
Questi uomini in macchina
Non scalare le rapide
Scritto sopra una lapide
In casa mia non c'è Dio
Ma se trovi il senso del tempo
Risalirai dal tuo oblio
E non c'è vento che fermi
La naturale potenza

Dal punto giusto di vista
Del vento senti l'ebrezza
Con ali in cera alla schiena
Ricercherò quell'altezza
Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta
Prova a tagliarmi la testa
Perché

Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro

Parla la gente purtroppo
Parla, non sa di che cosa parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria
Parla la gente purtroppo

Parla, non sa di che cosa parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I 'wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger

I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night


No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do in my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,

She is half your age,
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed,
I heard you've been missing me,
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumours?


Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of me,
And, boy, you're bringing me down,
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,


All of these words whispered in my ear,
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean I meant it,
People say crazy things,
Just 'cause I said it, don't that mean I meant it,
Just 'cause you heard it,

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,

But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for.",angry

And just one mistake
It's all it will take, we'll go down in history

Remember me for centuries

Mama, fight my teenage dreams
No it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong the story's aloof
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
I'm cruising on your thighs, leave my fingerprints

And this is for tonight
I thought that you would feel
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends untold

But you will remember me, remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take, we'll go down in history

Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop until the whole word knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there is a light, my shadow is over you

Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

And here's the frozen fruit
I could speak forever

We are the poisoned youth

I want it to be, like, messy

I'm so insecure I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the need
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fuckin' teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth"", I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help

And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kind of things I did
I'm relentlessly upset
The say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write

And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna

Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and a cherry on top
Shook up the bottom, made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie

I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew, 'cause they hope I choke

And I do my dance and cancel the plans

I'm only whatever you make me
And you make me more and more a villain every day
But you don't know, you reap, you sow
Whatever you give to me, from yourself, you take
Well, if you're a hater, then hate the creator
It's in your image I'm made

One eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised
'Cause I gave myself away for you
You liar, you don't love me too
It's easy for you after all


My heart is massive, but it's empty
A permanent part of me, that innocent artery
Is gaspin' for some real attention
Some undivided hypertension
Tell it, ""Quiet down, you're bein' loud""
But it beats harder every time you come around
But do you love the sound?

I sleep with one eye open and one eye closed
'Cause I'll hang myself if you give me rope
I lost all my faith and lost all hope
That everything means anything at all
One eye broken and one eye bruised
'Cause I gave myself away for you

Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from


She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah

Ci ho provato a liberarmi da quel senso di indesiderato
Ed ho fallito mille volte però ci ho provato
Ho messo pesi sulla schiena e poi sono caduto
Ho perso sangue dal naso e mi sono rialzato
Però a vent'anni già mi chiedo se son troppo stanco
Se quello che mi serve è quello che ho desiderato
Se un giorno riuscirò davvero ad esser realizzato
E sono spaventato

E tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo
Ho scelto sempre di essere uno ed uno soltanto
Toccare il cielo e ritornare a mangiare l'asfalto

A volte ho pianto, ma non è questo che mi ferma
Voglio il mio riscatto
Tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo
Ho scelto di essere uno ed uno soltanto
Toccare il cielo e tornare a mangiare asfalto
In nome del padre, del figlio e spirito santo

Ehi, fate spazio, fatene tanto
Che adesso non mi basta il mondo, non mi basta il palco

Mi hanno chiamato in tutti i modi, anche codardo
Son morto più di cento volte, mai morto invano
Tu dimmi che stai nascondendo, cos'hai nel palmo?
Perché dopo che mi hai guardato mi dai del pazzo?
Se pensi che sono cambiato, che sono un altro
Non hai capito un cazzo di niente, quindi che cazzo mi guardi?

Tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, te lo ripeto
Ho scelto di guardare più avanti di ciò che vedo
Il mio passato non me lo scordo, non lo rinnego
Colpisci forte, tanto non cado, rimango in piedi
Tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo
Ho scelto di essere uno ed uno soltanto

Pensavi che fossi morto e poi sono rinato
Di cos'è fare l'artista te ne hanno mai parlato?
Di tutto quello che ho perso, che ho sacrificato
Di non avere voce, restare senza fiato
Di avere mille persone che aspettano un tuo sbaglio

Sapere che ogni passo falso verrà condannato
Mi chiedo spesso se son stato solo fortunato
E non mi passa il moto della mia rabbia

Ci ho provato a liberarmi da quel senso di indesiderato
Ed ho fallito mille volte però ci ho provato
Ho messo pesi sulla schiena e poi sono caduto
Ho perso sangue dal naso e mi sono rialzato
Però a vent'anni già mi chiedo se son troppo stanco
Se quello che mi serve è quello che ho desiderato
Se un giorno riuscirò davvero ad esser realizzato
E sono spaventato

E tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo
Ho scelto sempre di essere uno ed uno soltanto
Toccare il cielo e ritornare a mangiare l'asfalto

A volte ho pianto, ma non è questo che mi ferma
Voglio il mio riscatto
Tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo
Ho scelto di essere uno ed uno soltanto
Toccare il cielo e tornare a mangiare asfalto
In nome del padre, del figlio e spirito santo

Ah, ah, ah, ehi
In nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo
Ah, ah, ah, ehi
In nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo
Ah, ah, ah, ehi
Nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo
Ah, ah, ah, ehi
Nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo

Ehi, fate spazio, fatene tanto
Che adesso non mi basta il mondo, non mi basta il palco

Mi hanno chiamato in tutti i modi, anche codardo
Son morto più di cento volte, mai morto invano
Tu dimmi che stai nascondendo, cos'hai nel palmo?
Perché dopo che mi hai guardato mi dai del pazzo?
Se pensi che sono cambiato, che sono un altro
Non hai capito un cazzo di niente, quindi che cazzo mi guardi?

Tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, te lo ripeto
Ho scelto di guardare più avanti di ciò che vedo
Il mio passato non me lo scordo, non lo rinnego
Colpisci forte, tanto non cado, rimango in piedi
Tu stammi ad un palmo dal culo, testa di cazzo
Ho scelto di essere uno ed uno soltanto
Toccare il cielo e tornare a mangiare asfalto
In nome del padre, del figlio e spirito santo


Ah, ah, ah, ehi
Nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo
Ah, ah, ah, ehi
Nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo
Ah, ah, ah, ehi
Nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo
Ah, ah, ah, ehi
Nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo

Ehi, per quello che ho vissuto, il tempo che ho buttato
Pensavi che fossi morto e poi sono rinato
Di cos'è fare l'artista te ne hanno mai parlato?
Di tutto quello che ho perso, che ho sacrificato
Di non avere voce, restare senza fiato
Di avere mille persone che aspettano un tuo sbaglio

Sapere che ogni passo falso verrà condannato
Mi chiedo spesso se son stato solo fortunato
E non mi passa il moto della mia rabbia
Spero che il mio passato se lo porti via la carta
È matto, questo è matto, chiedi perché lo faccio
In nome del padre, del figlio, spirito santo",angry

Oh you broke my heart
I told you I was weak for love
But then you went around
And did what you wanted to do
And now I'm crying, crying

Ooh it seemed like everything was going fine
I found the love that I thought was gonna last
But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
I even LOL'd man I should've known
Why why you're doing what you do
You you might as well just tell the honest truth
See I'm not really down with this
This ain't no texting shit
Know I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is


I don't really have much to say
I was over it the second that I saw her name

I got two, ooh letters for you
One of them is F and the other one is U
Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue
Only two, ooh ooh letters to choose
One of them is F and the other one is U

Would've been that, would've been that
You ain't with it, could've said that

I ain't trying to argue no more
I do it all for you, you know you're my right eye

Baby let me show you

Oh I know what's been going on
Dont even try to act like mr super nonchalant
What makes you think I'll stick around
I'm not as stupid as you sound
And you sound really dumb right now

But none of them are worth my time
You ain't even worth this rhyme

""Calmati"", ti ho detto, ""Guardami""
È finito il tempo di nascondersi dietro quegli angoli
Adesso dimmi dove corri e perché ansimi
Non l'hai mai visto chi ha ballato con i fottuti diavoli
Chi è cresciuto a sogni forti e mani fragili
Chi è stato spinto nella fossa, schiacciato ai margini
Coperto d'oro e poi trafitto, la bella Kahlo Frida
Davanti a tutti stavo zitto e invece adesso guardami

Quindi tu resta con il tuo gruppo
Striscia, prega, confonditi

A noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi
Siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
Non ce ne frega un cazzo di te
E del tuo gruppo con cui mangi, strisci, preghi, vomiti
A noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi
Siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti

E del tuo gruppo con cui mangi, strisci, preghi, vomiti
A noi il coraggio non ci manca, siamo impavidi
Siamo cresciuti con i lividi sui gomiti
Non ce ne frega un cazzo

E se vuoi sapere la mia storia siediti ed ascolta
Dura una manciata di secondi quindi adesso contali

Voler brillare avere paura e tutti gli altri complici
Della paura di brillare che abbiamo da giovani
Una bellissima morale ma da mezzi uomini
Una cultura secolare ma di stereotipi
Disprezza chi ha meno di te e quelli più in alto lodali
Onora tua madre e tuo padre ma da dietro sputagli
Però mi resta la mia strada, gli sguardi, tre amici non codardi
E se il mondo l'ha capito adesso inizierà a guardarci
Sono tanti gli stracci che ho preso senza lamentarmi
Io sono zero, ma lo zero piscia in testa a te e il tuo gruppo

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You ask me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)

The world goes on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma

And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl


Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me
Baby, God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Huh?)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only person who ever got you?

Hello
The sun, it brings the shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And oh, I've been living at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here

Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Hold you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close


I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversations
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night

I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel something (Feel something now)
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
(All night long, all night long, all night long)

Hello (hello)
I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you something that you already own (You own)
I can be whoever you want me to be


Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close (Oh)

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door

Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself

I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive

Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give

In a whole other life, there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman
We were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band
Wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the word, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like

Every time we go dancing, I see his straying eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my gears too many times
And when he start acting dumb, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in the tracks when I heard this melody
And it went like

[ Leigh-Anne]

He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sing me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sing me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on

[Perrie]

He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats
I was just his tiny dancer, he had control over my feet
That's when he came along, that's when I lost the groove
There was no song in the world
To sing along or make me move
Went something like

[ Jesy, (Perrie)]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Every time we go dancing, I see his straying eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my gears too many times
And when he start acting dumb, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in the tracks when I heard this melody
And it went like

[ Leigh-Anne]

He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sing me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sing me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on

[Perrie]

He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats
I was just his tiny dancer, he had control over my feet
That's when he came along, that's when I lost the groove
There was no song in the world
To sing along or make me move
Went something like

[ Jesy, (Perrie)]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Ok

[Nessa Barrett]
Does it rain in California?
Only dream I've ever known
Will they love you when you're famous
Where you'll never be alone?
Hope someday I'll find nirvana
I'll be looking down below
I'll be dead at twenty-seven
Only nine more years to go
I got a bully in my head
Fake love, fake friends
I was broken when you left
Now you hear me everywhere you go

Only dream I've ever known
Will they love you when you're famous
Where you'll never be alone?
Hope someday I'll find nirvana

I got a bully in my head

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said ""I'm having your baby, it's none of your business""

Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up [sniffing]

Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens

Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety",angry

I would take a little bite if I could
But some to say I don't know if I should
I could take you if I honestly would
You can take me, but I know you never would, check, rah

Pink party, cheekbones and glitter
À Paris, bad boys in slippers
Pink party, cheekbones and glitter
À Paris, bad boys in slippers

Saw the face of God at the tip of your tongue
She told me that I'm hot and a little bit dumb

I was like, ""Umm, I could be some""
Whatever, bum, with my boy brow on
I'm your new icon, I could answer your prayers
I could take 'em on with my boy brow
I'm your new icon, I could answer your prayers
I could take 'em on like a God
Red lips and a camera
Got away from Tampa
Steal a beat from the cinema
Got 'em wide-eyed, tongue-tied, copyright my dye
Took your parents to the Panama from my sorries
Show them life, how to live, how to die
Mommy, tell me what you like, what you hate all about me
She's a doll, kiss your cheek, gonna check, rah

Set that shit, man, don't mind him
But darl', I'm not sorry, hardly come party
But not next to me, though
Pink party for a day or a week (For a week?)

How could you let them turn you into a monster?

How could you let them turn you into a monster?

Goin' on a whim tryin' to erase it

I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wild, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive


And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mr Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her

'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wild, no

And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me

You, you, you oughta know

'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not gonna fade
As soon as you close your eyes and you know it
And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it.... well can you feel it

Shut the fuck up she said

I'm going fucking deaf

you're always too loud

everything's too loud



Now that all my friends left

this place is fucking dead

I want to move out

when can we move out

this shit has got to stop

I'll run away



Get the fuck up she said

your life is meaningless

it's going nowhere

you're going nowhere




You're just a fuck up she said

I'll live alone instead

she said ""you don't care""

I know I don't care

fuck off I'm not listening to you

and passed out on the plane

tried to forget you

I can't forget you

Take a deep breath, give them the finger

But I remember marching

Through the blaze

I remember coughing

But I believe in something

But I don't wanna remember falling


For your lies

Unbutton your clothes

Undress your soul

Show them your vigor

Are these inhibitions easiest to fear?

And c'mon take this gasoline tin

Head up high, walk like a winner

Let the bare feet be the last sound

That they hear

A decade ago

I never thought I would be

At twenty-three

On the verge of spontaneous combustion

Wo-is-me



But I guess that it comes with the territory

An ominous landscape of never ending calamity

I need you to hear

I need you to see that I have had all that I can take

And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me



So pardon me while I burst into flames

I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games


So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame

Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same



Not two days ago

I was having a look in a book

And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees

I said, 'I can relate'

`Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication

As a welcomed vacation 

From the burdens of the planet earth



Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D

And thinking so much differently



So pardon me while I burst into flames

I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games

A decade ago

I never thought I would be

At twenty-three

On the verge of spontaneous combustion

Wo-is-me



But I guess that it comes with the territory

An ominous landscape of never ending calamity

I need you to hear

I need you to see that I have had all that I can take

And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me



So pardon me while I burst into flames

I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games


So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame

Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same



Not two days ago

I was having a look in a book

And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees

I said, 'I can relate'

`Cause lately I've been thinking of combustication

As a welcomed vacation 

From the burdens of the planet earth



Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D

And thinking so much differently



So pardon me while I burst into flames

I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games


So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you’re alive and have a soul

I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

Get Up, Come On Get Down With The Sickness

Open Up Your Hate, And Let It Flow Into Me

Don't Try To Deny What You Feel

It Seems That All That Was Good Has Died

And Is Decaying In Me

But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?

Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

So am I still waiting

For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe",angry

The faster we're falling, 
We're stopping and stalling
We're running in circles again
Just as things were looking up
You said it wasn't good enough
But still we're trying one more time

Maybe we're just trying too hard
When really it's closer than it is too far

Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep, 
Up above in my head, instead of going under
Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep, 
Up above in my head, instead of going under
Instead of going under


Seems like each time 
I'm with you I lose my mind,
Because I'm bending over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain 
But when you're driving me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break

Maybe we're just trying too hard
When really it's closer than it is too far

Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep,

Up above in my head, instead of going under
Instead of going under

I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it you might as well embrace it
So believe me it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me,

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.

Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting

I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing

Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any

Sense of compassion

Between supposed lovers/brothers",angry

Keep holding on,
When my brain's ticking like a bomb.
Guess the black thoughts have come again to get me.
Sweet bitter words,
Unlike nothing I have heard.
Sing along mockingbird.
You don't affect me.

That's right.
Deliver it to my heart.
Please strike.
Be deliberate.

Wait.
I'm coming undone.

What looks so strong so delicate.
Wait.
I'm starting to suffocate.
And soon I anticipate.
I'm coming undone.

Choke, choke again.
I find my demons were my friends.
Getting me in the end,

They're out to get me.
Since I was young,
I tasted sorrow on my tongue.
And this sweet chugga gun does not protect me.

When ya don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks.
You don't really know why
But you wanna justify rippin' someone's head off

Always Coming In Last,

Bringing Up The Past.

No One Owes You Anything.

I Think You Need A Shotgun Blast,

A Kick In The Ass,

So Paranoid...

Watch Your Back!



Oh My, Here We Go...



Another Lose Cannon Gone Bi-Polar

Slipped Down, Couldn't Get Much Lower.

Quicksand's Got No Sense Of Humor.


I'm Still Laughing Like Hell.

You Think That The Cryin To Me,

Looking So Sorry That I'm Gonna Believe,

You've Been Infected By A Social Disease.

Well, Then Take Your Medicine.



[Chorus]

I Created The Sound Of Madness.

Wrote The Book On Pain.

Somehow I'm Still Here,

To Explain,

That The Darkest Hour Never Comes In The Night.

You Can Sleep With A Gun.

When You Gonna Wake Up And Fight... For Yourself?



I'm So Sick Of This Tombstone Mentality,

If There's An Afterlife,

Then It'll Set You Free.


But I'm Not Gonna Part The Seas

You're A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.

You Think That Cryin To Me,

Looking So Sorry That I'm Gonna Believe,

You've Been Infected By A Social Disease.

It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I want to live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid

And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend your locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me


Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take

Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change


It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid


Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop steppin'
Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me


Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change


This is a warning, like it or not
I break down, like a record spinning
Gotta get up
So back off
This is a warning, like it or not
I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up
There's a war going on inside of me tonight (Don't be afraid)

And three more to blow it away

Hold on for a second, if words can be weapons
Then what I say can effect it, they’re not just words on a record
And I can choose to respect it, or choose to infect it
But once it hits the water, it’s too late to be selective

‘Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up
It’s one belief, one spark, one faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart before it all falls apart


So stand up, shout it out, and put ‘em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let’s make it count, it’s a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out, sing it loud, so the world can’t drown us out
And before we depart, let’s leave a mark ‘cause light shines brighter in the dark

When we scream, our lips don’t make a sound
We march, with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road

So hold on for a moment, if we’re not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it, we’ll just plant the seed and keep growin’ it

And when that light shines in the mornin’, they’ll still be waken’ up yawning
But we’ll be smilin’ like we expected, with sweet victory one method

‘Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up
It’s one belief, one spark, one faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart before it all falls apart

‘Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up
It’s one belief, one spark, one faith and one restart
And we can reboot the whole chart before it all falls apart


So stand up, shout it out, and put ‘em in the air if you like it loud
We only got one shot, so let’s make it count, it’s a take down, nobody can stop us now
Stand up, shout it out, sing it loud, so the world can’t drown us out
And before we depart, let’s leave a mark ‘cause light shines brighter in the dark

When we scream, our lips don’t make a sound
We march, with feet on solid ground
We walk, where no one wants to go, on this untraveled road

So hold on for a moment, if we’re not scared of opponents
Then with what we have we can own it, we’ll just plant the seed and keep growin’ it

And when that light shines in the mornin’, they’ll still be waken’ up yawning
But we’ll be smilin’ like we expected, with sweet victory one method

‘Cause one voice is enough to make sleeping giants wake up
To make armies put their hands up and watch whole nations stand up

If you’re smart you’d run and protect yourself

And you can never understand my sickness

And a heart full of pain and sorrow

Cause nothing but failure follows me

I’m overcome by shame cause I can never change

I won't turn around
I won't turn around

Breaking the habit and melting the chains
Embracing the fear, chasing the fight
The glow of the fire will light up the night

There's a memory of how we used to be
That I can see through the flames
I am hypnotized as I fantasize
Forgetting lies and pain
But I can't go back

The ashes call my name

Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
Breaking the habit and melting the chains
Embracing the fear, chasing the fight
The glow of the fire will light up the night
The bridges are burning, the heat's on my face
Making the past an unreachable place
Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
I know, this is the point of no return


It's uncontrollable
Such a beautiful desire
There's something sinister about the way it hurts
When I watch it burn
(Higher and higher)
Because I can't go back

The ashes call my name

Pouring the fuel, fanning the flames
Breaking the habit and melting the chains
Embracing the fear, chasing the fight
The glow of the fire will light up the night
The bridges are burning, the heat's on my face

[Verse I]
The other night I had a dream
It was a world full of kings and queens
But it was cold, dark as the night
We were the fire under moonlit skies
We were divided, we were the same
And we were free, but we all wore chains
We couldn't see it, but we created
A place between truth and overrated


If I could just see it all
Just like a fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore

Like nothing never happened
Haven't seen you before?


I'm on the run from a thief I let into my head
I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared
When I turn and shout


I don't think I need you anymore
Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!
I don't think I need you anymore
Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!
I wanna live, I wanna be the change
We can all be kings and queens
If we can just learn to believe
If we can just learn to believe


We had a plan to build a wall
A great divide that would never fall
To separate us from all the pain
And keep the skeletons locked away
And brick by brick we built it so thick
That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight
And one by one we all became numb
We were making the bullets to a broken gun


If I could just see it all
Just like the fly on the wall
Would I be able to accept what I can't control?
And would I share what I saw?
Or just sit back and ignore
Like nothing never happened
And I haven't seen you before?

They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness
A million miles from emptiness

Suffocate everything

They seal your fate everyday but you can't believe it
Take yourself far away from nothingness

Remember the days of the innocence
Before it came in waves

Remember the trust it was blown away
Into oblivion

Remember love
Remember hate
Remember everything they said just to break you again
Remember all all of your enemies
Forever and ever they

Suffocate everything

Take yourself far away from nothingness

And the endlessness of all of our mistakes
Forget all the blame
And the apathy
And throw it all away

Forget the Pain
Forget the Hate
Forget all your Enemies
